# COS781 Data Mining Project
A comprehensive analysis of customer reordering behavior using the Instacart Market Basket dataset. I implemented and compare two advanced machine learning approaches: Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) with Adam optimization and XGBoost.


Run instructions:
  1. Download the Dataset:
     - Obtain the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis
  
  2. Extract the Dataset:
     - After downloading, extract the dataset into a folder on your system.
      
  3. Organize the Files:
     Create a new folder and move the following dataset files into it:
    -aisle.csv
    -department.csv
    -order_products__prior.csv
    -order_products__train.csv
    -orders.csv
    -products.csv
    -sample_submission.csv

  4. Download the Notebook
     - Download the Jupyter Notebook file market_analysis_final.ipynb from this GitHub repository and place it in the same folder with the dataset files.

     Your folder structure should look like this:
      Folder (Newly created folder)
      ├── market_analysis_final.ipynb
      ├── aisle.csv
      ├── department.csv
      ├── order_products__prior.csv
      ├── order_products__train.csv
      ├── orders.csv
      ├── products.csv
      ├── sample_submission.csv

  5. Run the Notebook:
     - Open the Jupyter Notebook file (market_analysis_final.ipynb) and execute all the cells using the menu option Cell > Run All.

  6. View Notebook Outputs on GitHub:
     - Alternatively, you can view the executed notebook directly in this repository. Click on the file market_analysis_final.ipynb to see the outputs displayed in the GitHub interface.
